    "A robot, much like you, perceives the world through its \"senses.\" For example, self-driving cars use video, radar, and Lidar, to observe the world around them. As cars gather data, they build up a 3D world of observations that tells the car where it is, where other objects (like trees, pedestrians, and other vehicles) are, and where it should be going! \n",

    "In this section, we'll be working with a 2D representation of the world for simplicity, and because two dimensions are often all you'll need to solve a certain problem.\n",

    "This demonstration shows how to represent a robot's world as a 2D array of observations, in this case, we'll work with a simple example that uses  integer variables to represent whether there is (1) or is not (0) a tree present at that location on the grid.\n",

    "\n",
    "Which indicates that there are only two trees: one at the top rightmost point in its world, and one at the leftmost bottom. In fact the coordinates or indices of these tree locations are [0, 3] for the top-right corner and [1, 0] for the bottom-left. This has to do with the way indices are counted in Python. A graphical representation is shown below.\n",
