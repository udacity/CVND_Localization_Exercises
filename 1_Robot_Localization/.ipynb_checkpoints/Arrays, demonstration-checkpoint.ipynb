    "Arrays are data structures that can contain multiple values, similar to lists in Python, but they only contain one type of data i.e. all integers or all characters, and they are often used to represent a robot's environment. This is easiest to see in an example. Say we have a self-driving car driving on a one-lane road, and near the end of this road is a stop sign, as in the below image.\n",
